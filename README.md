NewsGird is a replica of a news site that I created using HTML and SCSS. The project aims to showcase my web development skills and demonstrate my proficiency in front-end technologies.

## Project Overview

NewsGird is a responsive and visually appealing replica of a popular news website. It features a grid-based layout with responsive design, allowing users to easily access news articles on various devices.

The main objective of this project was to practice my HTML and SCSS skills, including:

- Creating a responsive grid layout using Flexbox or CSS Grid.
- Styling the site with SCSS to achieve a modern and professional look.
- Implementing media queries to ensure the site's responsiveness on different screen sizes.
