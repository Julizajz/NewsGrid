<h1>NewsGrid Sample Website</h1>
<p>In this project, I made a simple news website using HTML and CSS.</p>
<br>
<p>When it came to the layout of the site, I wanted to incoperate what I learned from CSS and format the content using just the grid system. Majority of the formating was done either by alinging specific elements or creating gird coloumns to display different parts of the site. </p>
<br>
<p>The website includes three main parts. The home, the about page and one single article post that's linked in the showcase area of the home page. This site is also responsvie on smartphones and tablets.</p>
